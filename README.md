The FellowShip Wall – Interactive Engagement Platform
Welcome to the repository for Asmodee’s Global Engagement Platform – a playful and meaningful internal web application designed to foster human connection, collaboration, and a shared sense of belonging across all Asmodee entities worldwide.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This interactive platform is integrated into Asmodee’s Hub and offers a variety of experiences aimed at encouraging communication, recognition, and fun among employees around the globe.

## 🌟 Key Features
Interactive Globe
Explore all Asmodee offices around the world and interact with colleagues by sending cheerful, predefined messages like “Be bold!” or “Have a great day!”.
To create the globe, we used Three.js to have a 3D object, so that we could add the structures and the arcs. 

## Parrot Talk
A short, weekly 5-minute ritual led by each team manager to reflect on one of Asmodee’s core values – shared with the rest of the company afterward.

## Game Connect
A selection of 30 games from Board Game Arena, where employees can challenge a colleague from another office via matchmaking.

## Sink or Sail
Every quarter, employees vote on which 5 new games will be added to the platform next season.

## Pirate’s Council
A peer-to-peer recognition system where employees can award virtual badges to celebrate one another’s contributions.

## Treasure Trail
A fun, gamified leaderboard system that encourages participation through friendly competition.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, SCSS, Nivo (For the radar graphic on the Sink or Sail page)

Backend: Node.js (Express), Knex.js, PostgreSQL

The games are only created in a database, we could not find a public API to integrate BGA's games.
